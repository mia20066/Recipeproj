      '1-Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the eggplant from sticking to the pan. Halve the eggplants lengthwise and brush the cut sides lightly with olive oil. Place them in the prepared pan with the halved sides down.\n'
      + '2-Roast the eggplant until the interior is very tender throughout and the skin is collapsing, about 35 to 40 minutes (this might take longer if you are using 1 large eggplant). Set the eggplant aside to cool for a few minutes. Flip the eggplants over and scoop out the flesh with a large spoon, leaving the skin behind.\n'
      + '3-Place a mesh strainer over a mixing bowl, then transfer the flesh to the strainer and discard the skins. Pick out any stray bits of eggplant skin and discard. You want to remove as much moisture from the eggplant here as possible, so let the eggplant rest for a few minutes and shake/stir the eggplant to release some more moisture.\n'

      + '4-Discard all of the eggplant drippings, drain and wipe out the bowl, and dump the eggplant into the bowl. Add the garlic and lemon juice to the eggplant and stir vigorously with a fork until eggplant breaks down. Add the tahini to the bowl and stir until it’s incorporated. While stirring, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Continue stirring until the mixture is pale and creamy, and use your fork to break up any particularly long strings of eggplant.\n'
      + '5-Stir in the parsley, salt and cumin. Season to taste with more salt (I usually add another ¼ teaspoon) and more lemon juice, if you would like a more tart flavor.\n'
      + '6-Transfer the baba ganoush to a serving bowl and lightly drizzle olive oil on top. Lastly, sprinkle parsley and smoked paprika on top. Serve with accompaniments of your choice. Its also great on sandwiches!\n'

      +'2-POTATOES: Allow the potatoes to come back to a boil and cook about halfway through, about 8-10 minutes. Test using a paring knife, it should go through with some resistance. Drain the potatoes, place them back in the same pot. Add 1 tablespoon of ghee and a big pinch of salt and toss to combine. Set aside.\n'
      +'3-ROAST: When the oven is preheated, line with parchment if desired, I usually skip it. Spray sheet pan with cooking spray and quickly spread potatoes out in a single layer. Bake for 20 minutes. Then toss and continue baking for another 8 minutes or until the potatoes are golden.\n'
      
      +'4-LEMON CILANTRO SAUCE: Once you toss the potatoes, heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Add 2 tablespoons of ghee. When hot, add the coriander seeds, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes. Continue to cook for 30-45 seconds or until the garlic is fragrant. Add cilantro, add 2 tbsps juice, and the lemon zest to the pan. Stir to combine; remove from heat. Add the remaining lemon juice and stir together.\n'
      +'5-TOSS AND SERVE: When the potatoes are done, toss them in the lemon and cilantro sauce, return to the baking sheet. Bake for another 5 minutes then sprinkle with remaining cilantro and serve warm with roasted chicken or whatever else you like!\n'
